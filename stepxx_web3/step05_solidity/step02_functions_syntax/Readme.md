# Functions

Functions are the mechanism to read and write values from/to state variables. When a function in a contract is called or invoked externally, it results in the creation of a transaction. 
Functions are a unit of code that can be executed on-demand by calling it. Functions can accept parameters, execute their logic, and optionally return values to the caller. They can be named as well as being anonymous. Solidity provides named functions, with the possibility of only one unnamed function in a contract, called the fallback function
