# Calldata and Stack:

Calldata and the Stack are both important components of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that are used during the execution of a contract.

# Call Data: 

This is where all incoming function execution data, including function arguments, is stored. This is a non-modifiable memory location.

The call data is a part of the input to a contract function that contains the function selector and any function arguments that were passed to the function. When a contract function is called, the call data is loaded onto the stack and used to determine which function to execute and with what arguments. The call data is also used to compute the gas cost of the function call.

# Stack:

The stack is a data structure used by the EVM to store intermediate values and execute instructions. When a contract function is executed, the EVM pushes the function arguments and any intermediate values onto the stack as it executes the function. Once the function is finished executing, the return value is pushed back.

# Note:

It's important to note that the stack has a limited size, and exceeding this size can cause the EVM to throw an exception and revert the transaction. Solidity provides some mechanisms for managing the stack, such as using local variables to store intermediate values and minimizing the use of complex expressions that can lead to stack overflow.
