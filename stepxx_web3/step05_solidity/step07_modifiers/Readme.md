# Modifiers

In Solidity, a modifier is always associated with a function. A modifier in programming
languages refers to a construct that changes the behavior of code under execution. Since a
modifier is associated with a function in Solidity, it has the power to change the behavior
of functions that it is associated with. For an easy understanding of modifiers, think
of them as a function that will be executed before the execution of the target function.

Modifiers in Solidity are used to modify the behavior of functions by adding additional checks or constraints before the function executes.
