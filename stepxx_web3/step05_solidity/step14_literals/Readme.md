# Using literals

Solidity provides the use of literals for assignments to variables. 
Literal refers to a fixed value that appears directly in the source code.
Literals do not have names. 
They are the values themselves. 
Variables can change their values during program execution, 
But a literal retains the same value throughout. 

Take a look at the following examples of various literals:

• Examples of integer literals are 1, 10, 1,000, -1, and -100.
• Examples of string literals are "Ritesh" and 'Modi'. String literals can be in single or double quotation marks.
• Examples of address literals are 0xca35b7d915458ef540ade6068dfe2f44e8fa733c and 0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111.
• Hexadecimal literals are prefixed with the hex keyword. An example of a hexadecimal literal is hex"1A2B3F".

Literals are used extensively in Solidity code to specify initial values for variables, parameters, and other data structures.
