# Data Locations

The data location of a variable is dependent on the following two factors:

• The location of the variable declaration
• The data type of the variable

Based on the preceding two factors, there are rules that govern and decide the data
location of a variable.

Data locations also affect the way the assignment operator works. Both assignment and data
locations are explained by means of the rules that govern them.

There are eight rules to decide whether to store data at storage level or at memory level.

First four rules define define storage level on the basis of data location.

Next four rules are defining data assignment behavior i.e. whether they will pass by value or pass by reference.
