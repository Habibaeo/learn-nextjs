# Structures

A structure is a composite data type, consisting of multiple variables of different data types. They are very similar to contracts; however, they do not contain any logic within them. They consist of
only variables.

There may be times when you want to store related data together. Suppose you want to
store information about an employee, such as the employee's name, age, marriage status,
and bank account numbers.
