# Enumerations

The enum keyword is used to declare enumerations. Enumerations help in declaring
a custom user-defined data type in Solidity. enum consists of an enumeration list â€“ a
predetermined set of named constants.

It is not mandatory to define enum in a Solidity contract. enum should be defined if
there is a constant list of items that do not change.
