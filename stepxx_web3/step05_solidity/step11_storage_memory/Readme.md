# Storage and memory data locations:

In Solidity, there are two primary data locations where variables can be stored: storage and memory.

# Storage: 

Storage refers to a persistent, on-chain location where data is stored across function calls and even across different contracts. Storage is typically used to store state variables that need to be accessed and modified across different functions and contract instances. 

Accessing and modifying storage variables requires more gas than accessing and modifying memory variables, due to the additional overhead involved in reading and writing to the blockchain.

This is global memory available to all functions within a contract. This storage is permanent storage that Ethereum stores on every node within its environment.

# Memory: 

Memory refers to a temporary location where data is stored during function execution. Memory is typically used to store local variables, function arguments, and other data that is only needed during the execution of a single function call. Accessing and modifying memory variables is generally less expensive in terms of gas cost than accessing and modifying storage variables.

By default, function parameters and local variables are stored in memory. However, Solidity provides ways to explicitly specify the data location for a variable using the memory and storage keywords. For example, you can define a function parameter as memory uint[] to indicate that it should be stored in memory, or as storage uint[] to indicate that it should be stored in storage.

This is local memory available to every function within a contract. This is short-lived and fleeting memory that gets torn down when a function completes its execution.

# Note:

It's important to keep in mind the differences between storage and memory when writing Solidity code, as choosing the wrong data location can result in higher gas costs or unexpected behavior. It's generally a good idea to use memory for local variables and function arguments, and storage for state variables that need to persist across function calls.
